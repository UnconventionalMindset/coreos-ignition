# Fedora Core OS setup

## Goal

- [x] Github action to convert Butane to Ignite.
- [ ] Creation of ISO image that automatically install Fedora Core OS using the `coreos.ign` present in this repo from its url. Used for provisioning in my Proxmox.
Current script to embed the ignite to the iso is here: https://gist.github.com/UnconventionalMindset/632f3892e2149ac826af90892d0cca13
- [ ] Setting up Core OS to reprovision at reboot without losing data
